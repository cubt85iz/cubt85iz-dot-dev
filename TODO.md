# TODO

- Recipe to convert images to webp?
- Prefer page bundles over single files.
  - ex: content/docs/my-doc/index.md;image.webp
- axe-core
- add recipe to parse front matter and reorganize documents to maintain alphabetic sort for docs. This would need to occur when removing, modifying or deleting a document.
